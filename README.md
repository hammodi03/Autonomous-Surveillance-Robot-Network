# Autonomous-Surveillance-Robot-Network

GuardRobot is an autonomous indoor security robot built using an ESP32/Arduino-based embedded system, together with a Python server for data collection. The robot navigates between rooms using IR sensors, detects people and objects with radar, and manages its battery level by automatically returning to a charging station when needed. It communicates with a server that logs activity and visualizes the robot’s state and environment on a shared map of the monitored area.
