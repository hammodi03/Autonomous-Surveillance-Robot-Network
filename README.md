# Autonomous-Surveillance-Robot-Network

GuardRobot is an autonomous indoor security robot built using an ESP32/Arduino-based embedded system, together with a Python server for gathering data.
The robot navigates between rooms with the help of IR sensors, detects people and objects with the use of radar, and manages its own battery level by returning to a charging station when needed. 
It communicates with a server that logs activity and visualizes the robot’s state and environment over the map the robots are distributed over.
